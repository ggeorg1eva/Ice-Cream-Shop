This is a java project which implements the use of four design patterns - Singleton, Factory, Decorator and Strategy.

## Description
A basic program which is created based on this problem:
A young family is opening an ice cream shop where they offer three types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.
Each ice cream can be topped with either chocolate glaze or chocolate chips.
Customers who visit the shop choose an ice cream and optionally a topping, and then they can enjoy their ice cream in the shop, in the park, or on the beach.
